# Course Notes on SQL Course

* The files contain all of the notes and problems solved throughout this course. The purpose of taking this course is to upskill and learn the basics of MySQL. The file names are self-explanatory and are representative of what was learned in this course. This course uses an employees database and focuses primarily on data structure, building tables, and more advanced topics such as stored routines, aggregate functions, and subqueries. 

* While doing an exercise, I may have used an alternate route to get the same solution. My personal solutions along side the course solutions are all provided in the scripts. 

* You can download the employees database [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/znmjrtlae6vt4zi/employees.sql?dl=0).

* Once the data base is loaded, make sure you run "use employees;" prior to any scripts being run. The scripts can be run in any order.
